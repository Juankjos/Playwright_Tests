# Playwright_Tests: First steps

To start the new project we will need to install all the dependencies, as it says, we need to run the next command:
- ***npm init playwright@latest***
  **It is important to read the documentation of playwright, for example, to follow the language you will like to use as Javasacript or Typescript, so go on**
  
After that, we will need to install the node dependecies
- ***npm i***

If you like, you may create a folder for screenshots for your tests, 
  or even playwright can create videos of your tests adding the video configuration in playwright.config.js, no more thant 3 lines of code!
